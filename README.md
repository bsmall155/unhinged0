# unhinged0
This project is was for my CS234 class.
The website is named unhinged and has the purpose of allowing users to create profiles with a username and password. If they choose they can also add multiple emails.
The home page will ask users to choose their preferences from a list, which will be saved in a table, and they can then view their results. 
The website has some user CRUD and full admin CRUD.
